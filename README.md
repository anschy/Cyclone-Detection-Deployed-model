Tropical Coastal areas in the part of Odisha suffers cyclones and associated storm regularly and thus do a lot of damage, therefore with the help of the satellite images, we prepared a model that can help to (which need to be later integrated into an app) detect the cyclone via pattern recognition as soon as possible and send the alert to our app users.
